// Given an array of integers, update every element with the multiplication of previous and next elements with the following exceptions: a) The First element is replaced by the multiplication of the first and second. b) The last element is replaced by multiplication of the last and second last. (Ex: Input : arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, Output : arr[] = {6, 8, 15, 24, 30})


let arr = [1,2,3 ,4,5,6]
let arr2 =[]
for(let i = 0 ; i < arr.length ; i++){
    if(i == 0){
        arr2.push(arr[i] * arr[i+1])
    }else if(i == arr.length-1){
        arr2.push(arr[i-1]*arr[i])
    }else{
        arr2.push(arr[i-1]*arr[i+1])
    }
}
console.log(arr2)
